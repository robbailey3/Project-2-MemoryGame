## How to Play the Game

Depending on which level you choose, the game board will contain between 12 and 24 cards arranged in a grid.

- Easy: 6 pairs of cards
- Medium: 8 pairs of cards
- Hard: 12 pairs of cards

On each turn, the user will click on a card to reveal the picture underneath. The user will then pick another card. If the images on both flipped cards match, the cards will remain flipped, if not, the cards will flip back. The game will end when all cards have been flipped.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
